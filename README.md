# BDDA_Mid_Term_Projects


#### Project-1

*All State Severity*
When you've been severely injured in a vehicle accident, your priorities are your family, friends, and other loved ones. The last thing you want to do is spend time or mental energy pushing paper with your insurance representative. For the nearly 16 million families they cover, Allstate, a personal insurance in the US, is constantly looking for new ways to enhance its claims process.
Allstate is actively working on automated techniques for estimating claim severity and expense.

*Objective*
Creating an algorithm which accurately predicts claims severity.


#### Project-2

*Click Through Rate*
In online advertising, click-through rate (CTR) is a very important metric for evaluating ad performance. As a result, click prediction systems are essential and widely used for sponsored search and real-time bidding.


*Objective*
To analyze how many clicks or unclicks are done through different factors which are there in the data set.


In both of the projects we practiced:
1. Data Exploration & Visualization
2. Feature Engineering
3. Data Structuring
4. Pipelining
5. Cross Validation
6. Hypermetric Tuning
